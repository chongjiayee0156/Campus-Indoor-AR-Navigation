# Campus Indoor AR Navigation App

This project is a Campus Indoor Augmented Reality (AR) Navigation App developed using Android Studio. The app provides real-time indoor navigation with voice guidance, utilizing BLE beacons for localization and Mapbox API for the map view. The floor maps were scraped from the MazeMap API.

## Features

- **Voice Navigation**: Provides step-by-step voice instructions for navigation.
- **Augmented Reality**: Displays navigation routes in AR for an immersive experience.
- **Map View**: Utilizes Mapbox API to show a 2D map view of the campus.
- **Localization**: Uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons for precise indoor localization.

## Requirements

- Android Studio
- Android device with BLE support
- BLE beacons deployed on campus

**Note:** This project is still in progress.
